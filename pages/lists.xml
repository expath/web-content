      <para>Communication is handled by <link href="http://groups.google.com/group/expath">Google
            Groups</link> tools. It offers a regular mailing list as well as archive management.
         Since EXPath has been accepted as a <link href="http://w3.org/community/expath/">W3C
            group</link>, the main mailing list for everything related to the specifications is the
         CG mailing list, whilst everything else (including specific implementations, tools, etc.)
         is discussed on the general list.</para>
