      <para>The <link href="http://exist-db.org/">eXist</link>, <link
            href="http://www.xmlmind.com/qizx/">Qizx</link> and <link
            href="http://basex.org/">BaseX</link> XML databases all implements built-in the
         Packaging System.  There are external implementations for the <link
            href="http://www.saxonica.com/">Saxon</link> XSLT and XQuery processor and the
         <link href="http://xmlcalabash.com/">Calabash</link> XProc processor (see the <link
            href="http://code.google.com/p/expath-pkg/">project home</link> for details and
         downloads for those external implementations).</para>
      <para>All those implementations rely on the same underlying repository structure, and
         actually all use the same repository manager written in Java as part of the above mentioned
         <link href="http://code.google.com/p/expath-pkg/">expath-pkg project</link>.  They also all
         support packaging extension functions written in Java.</para>
      <para>The <link href="http://code.google.com/p/expath-pkg/">expath-pkg project</link> also
         provides a repository manager, called <code>xrepo</code>, to help managing packages in
         a repository (installing, removing, listing, etc.)  The same implementations are also used
         in <link href="http://code.google.com/p/servlex/">Servlex</link>, the framework used to
         run the EXPath website, based exclusively on XML technologies.</para>

      <title>Console for MarkLogic</title>

      <para>A first version of an EXPath Console for MarkLogic is going to be released soon.  You
         can already test it.  Just download the source
         <link href="http://code.google.com/p/expath-pkg/downloads/list">from Google Code</link>
         (look for the latest "expath-ml-console.*.zip").  Unzip it somewhere on your filesystem, create a
         new HTTP server in MarkLogic, point the modules of that HTTP server to the filesystem,
         where you saved the sources, go to <code>http://localhost:xxx/home.xq</code> and follow the
         instructions. You might want to look at the Help page as well, from the menu on the
         page.</para>
