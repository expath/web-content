      <para>The Binary module is designed to support the processing, within XPath/XQuery/XSLT, of
         fundamentally binary data, found in situations such as inspecting images (for size and
         metadata), processing files which contain different text sections in different encodings
         and more esoteric subjects such as manipulating large cryptographic keys, or generating PDF
         files.</para>
      <para>It comprises a small set of extension functions for XPath/XQuery expressions that enable
         binary data (i.e. potentially large sequences of bytes) to be created, reduced to byte
         sequences, manipulated as bit-strings, joined into larger sequences, split, extended and
         searched. Functions are provided to convert to and from numeric forms, and text strings via
         encoding protocols.</para>
      <para>Test-suites are available for developers to verify implementations. Some samples using
         the module are provided in the specification - other more sizeable ones should hopefully
         appear in the Samples area of this section of the website.</para>
